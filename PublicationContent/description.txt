[h1]Usage (single player)[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Subscribe to this mutator;
[*]Start KF2;
[*]Create a file [b](*)[/b]: [b]C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Config\KFCTI.ini[/b]
with the following content:
[b][CTI.CTI]
Version=0[/b]
[*]Open console (~) and input:
[b]open KF-BioticsLab?Mutator=CTI.Mut[/b]
(replace the map and add the parameters you need)
[*]<Enter>.
[/olist]
[h1]Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If you don't understand what is written here, read the article [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url] before following these instructions.[/i]
[olist]
[*]Open your [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b];
[*]Find the [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and make sure that there is a line (add if not):
[b]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/b]
‚ùóÔ∏è If there are several [b]DownloadManagers=[/b] then the line above should be the first ‚ùóÔ∏è
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[b]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2830826239[/b]
[*]Start the server and wait while the mutator is downloading;
[*]Create a file [b](*)[/b]: [b]<kf2-server>\KFGame\Config\KFCTI.ini[/b]
with the following content:
[b][CTI.CTI]
Version=0[/b]
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [b]?Mutator=CTI.Mut[/b] and restart the server.
[/olist]

[h1][b](*)[/b] Buggy config variables initialization[/h1]
CTI, like many other mutators, initializes the config by relying on the unreal script feature which uses default values for each data type that is not explicitly specified. For the int type (which is used to store the config version) this is zero - detecting zero allows to understand that the mutator is being used for the first time (which means it's need to generate a config). But now the game contains a bug that initializes the config values ‚Äã‚Äãrandomly if they are not explicitly set. Thus, the config may have incorrect values ‚Äã‚Äãor not be created at all. This is why I recommend explicitly set [b]Version=0[/b] in the config for the first time.

Unfortunately I can't do anything about it because it's a game problem (not mutator). I hope TWI fixes this someday.

[h1]Setup (KFCTI.ini)[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]bDisableItemLimitCheck[/b]: The original game does not support more than 256 trader items, adding items above this limit causes bugs. If this problem is solved (For example, if you are using a mutator that has already fixed this problem or by enabling [b]bApplyPatch[/b]) then it can be set [b]bDisableItemLimitCheck=True[/b] to remove the limit, otherwise it is better to leave it [b]False[/b].

[*]Set [b]bApplyPatch=True[/b] to fix some base classes of the game: this fixes problems when adding more than 256 items to a trader and will allow players to sell weapons that have been removed from trader inventory. Note that enabling this parameter replaces the following classes: [b]KFAutoPurchaseHelper[/b], [b]KFInventoryManager[/b], [b]KFGFxMenu_Trader[/b], [b]KFGFxObject_TraderItems[/b]. There may be compatibility issues with mutators that also replace them.

[*]Set [b]bPreloadContent=True[/b] to load weapon models in advance and have no lags when someone buys weapons. In some cases (usually if there is a lot of custom content), enabling preload can cause models to disappear. It is recommended to test how this setting affects the game for your server configuration and then decide whether to enable preloading or not.

[*]Set [b]bOfficialWeaponsList=True[/b] to have an auto-updated list of all official weapons in the config (for a convenient copy-paste) or leave it [b]False[/b] if you want a clean config without unnecessary things.

[*]Set [b]UnlockDLC[/b] to customize DLC weapon unlocks. Here are the possible values:
[list]
[*][b]False[/b] - disable DLC unlock.
[*][b]ReplaceFilter[/b] - changes the trader filter allowing you to buy original DLC weapons without restrictions, unlocks future DLCs as well (no need to update this mutator). However, it replaces the - [b]KFGFxMoviePlayer_Manager[/b] class so it may not be compatible with mods that also replace it.
[*][b]ReplaceWeapons[/b] - replaces DLC weapons with their unlocked variants. Compatible with any mods, but may require a CTI update after the release of new DLC weapons.
[*][b]True[/b] or [b]Auto[/b] - selects the most appropriate option automatically. Recommend putting CTI.Mut last in the mutator load queue if you use this.
[/list]

[*]Use [b][CTI.RemoveItems][/b] to remove items from the trader inventory.
example: [b]Item=KFGame.KFWeapDef_Mac10[/b] will remove MAC10 from sale.

[*]Set [b]bALL=True[/b] if you want to remove all items (can be useful if you want to set the entire sale list in the [b][CTI.AddItems][/b] section yourself).
[*]Set [b]bHRG=True[/b] to remove HRG items.
[*]Set [b]bDLC=True[/b] to remove DLC items.

[*]Use [b][CTI.AddItems][/b] to add items to the trader inventory.
example: [b]Item=WeaponPackExt.KFWeapDef_XM25[/b] will add [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1147408497]XM25[/url] to sale.
[/list]

[h1]Notes[/h1]
üìå If you need an empty list anywhere (for example, you don't want to delete some of the traders's weapons), leave at least one line there:
[b]Item=[/b]
This is necessary to explicitly initialize the list (because of the bug I wrote about above) to avoid initialization with incorrect values.
üìå Mutator does not contain custom weapons. You must have the required weapon packs in your subscriptions to be able to add them to the trader.
üìå If you are using this mutator to add weapons, you should [b]not[/b] use mutators from weapon packs (just having them in subscriptions is enough).
