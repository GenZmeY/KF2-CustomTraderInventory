[h1]Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If you don't understand what is written here, read the article [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url] before following these instructions.[/i]
[olist]
[*]Open your [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b];
[*]Find the [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and make sure that there is a line (add if not):
[b]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/b]
‚ùóÔ∏è If there are several [b]DownloadManagers=[/b] then the line above should be the first ‚ùóÔ∏è
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[b]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2830826239[/b]
[*]Start the server and wait while the mutator is downloading;
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [b]?Mutator=CTI.CTIMut[/b] and restart the server.
[/olist]

[h1]Setup (KFCTI.ini)[/h1]
Config will be created at the first start[b]*[/b].
[list]
[*]Set [b]bPreloadContent=True[/b] to load weapon models in advance and have no lags during the game.

[*]Set [b]bOfficialWeaponsList=True[/b] to have an auto-updated list of all official weapons in the config (for a convenient copy-paste).

[*]Set [b]UnlockDLC[/b] to customize DLC weapon unlocks. Here are the possible values:
[list]
[*][b]False[/b] - disable DLC unlock.
[*][b]ReplaceFilter[/b] - changes the trader filter allowing you to buy original DLC weapons without restrictions, unlocks future DLCs as well (no need to update this mutator). However, it replaces the - [b]KFGFxMoviePlayer_Manager[/b] class so it may not be compatible with mods that also replace it.
[*][b]ReplaceWeapons[/b] - replaces DLC weapons with their unlocked variants. Compatible with any mods, but may require a CTI update after the release of new DLC weapons.
[*][b]True[/b] or [b]Auto[/b] - selects the most appropriate option automatically. Recommend putting CTIMut last in the mutator load queue if you use this.
[/list]

[*]Use [b][CTI.RemoveItems][/b] to remove items from the trader inventory.
example: [b]Item=KFGame.KFWeapDef_Mac10[/b] will remove MAC10 from sale.

[*]Set [b]bAll=True[/b] if you want to remove all items (can be useful if you want to set the entire sale list in the [b][CTI.AddItems][/b] section yourself).

[*]Use [b][CTI.AddItems][/b] to add items to the trader inventory.
example: [b]Item=WeaponPack.KFWeapDef_XM25[/b] will add [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1147408497]XM25[/url] to sale.

[h1]Notes[/h1]
üìå Mutator does not contain custom weapons. You must have the required weapon packs in your subscriptions to be able to add them to the trader.
üìå If you are using this mutator to add weapons, you should [b]not[/b] use mutators from weapon packs (just having them in subscriptions is enough).

[h1]Troubleshooting[/h1]
[b](*)[/b] If your config is not created for some reason, create it manually with the following content:
[b][CTI.CTI]
Version=0
[/b]

Then start the server and check the file again - config content should be generated.
