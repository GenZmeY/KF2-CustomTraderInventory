[h1]‚ùå Whitelisted?[/h1]
No. This mod is not whitelisted and will de-rank your server. Any XP earned will not be saved.

[h1]üéÆ Usage (single player)[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Subscribe to this mutator.
[*]Create a file [b](*)[/b]: [code]C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Config\KFCTI.ini[/code]
with content:
[code][CTI.CTI]
Version=0[/code]
[*]Launch KF2.
[*]Open console (~) and start any map with the mutator (this will generate the default KFCTI.ini content):
[code]open KF-BioticsLab?Mutator=CTI.Mut[/code]
[*]Close the game and configure the mutator (see [b]‚öôÔ∏è Setup (KFCTI.ini)[/b] below).
[*]Launch KF2 again, open the console, and start the game:
[code]KF-BioticsLab?Game=KFGameContent.KFGameInfo_Survival?Difficulty=3?GameLength=2?Mutator=CTI.Mut[/code]
(replace the map and set/add parameters you need).
[/olist]

[h1]üñ•Ô∏è Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If this is unclear, first read: [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server Guide (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url][/i]
[olist]
[*]Open [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b].
[*]Find [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and ensure line exists (add if missing):
[code]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/code]
(If there are several [b]DownloadManagers[/b] then the line above should be the first)
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[code]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2830826239[/code]
[*]Start server and wait for mutator download.
[*]When the download is complete, stop the server.
[*]Create a file [b](*)[/b]: [code]<kf2-server>\KFGame\Config\KFCTI.ini[/code]
with content:
[code][CTI.CTI]
Version=0[/code]
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [code]?Mutator=CTI.Mut[/code] and start the server (this will generate the default KFCTI.ini content).
[*]Stop the server and configure the mutator (see [b]‚öôÔ∏è Setup (KFCTI.ini)[/b] below).
[*]Start the server.
[/olist]

[h1]üêû (*) Buggy config initialization[/h1]
This mutator (like many others) relies on UnrealScript's default values (0 for int type) to detect first-time use and generate a config.
However, the game contains a bug that initializes unset values to random data, which can lead to incorrect settings or missing configs.

As a workaround, I recommend explicitly setting [b]Version=0[/b] in the config during the first initialization.

Unfortunately, I can't fix this issue because it's a game engine problem (not the mutator's fault).

[h1]‚öôÔ∏è Setup (KFCTI.ini)[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]bDisableItemLimitCheck[/b]: The original game does not support more than 256 trader items: exceeding this limit causes issues. If this problem is solved (for example, if you are using a mutator that has already fixed this problem or by enabling [b]bApplyPatch[/b]) then it can be set [b]bDisableItemLimitCheck=True[/b] to remove the limit, otherwise it is better to leave it [b]False[/b].

[*]Set [b]bApplyPatch=True[/b] to fix some base classes of the game: this fixes problems when adding more than 256 items to a trader and will allow players to sell weapons that have been removed from trader inventory. Note that enabling this parameter replaces the following game classes: [b]KFAutoPurchaseHelper[/b], [b]KFInventoryManager[/b], [b]KFGFxMenu_Trader[/b], [b]KFGFxObject_TraderItems[/b]. There may be compatibility issues with mutators that also replace them.

[*]Set [b]bPreloadContent=True[/b] to load weapon models in advance and have no lags when someone buys weapons. In some cases (usually if there is a lot of custom content), enabling preload may cause models to disappear. It is recommended to test how this setting affects the game for your server configuration and then decide whether to enable preloading or not.

[*]Set [b]bOfficialWeaponsList=True[/b] to have an auto-updated list of all official weapons in the config (for a convenient copy-paste) or leave it [b]False[/b] if you want a clean config without unnecessary things.

[*]Set [b]UnlockDLC[/b] to customize DLC weapon unlocks. Here are the possible values:
[list]
[*][b]False[/b] - disable DLC unlock.
[*][b]ReplaceFilter[/b] - changes the trader filter allowing you to buy original DLC weapons without restrictions, unlocks future DLCs as well (no need to update this mutator). However, it replaces the [b]KFGFxMoviePlayer_Manager[/b] class so it may not be compatible with mods that also replace it.
[*][b]ReplaceWeapons[/b] - replaces DLC weapons with their unlocked variants. Compatible with any mods, but may require a CTI update after the release of new DLC weapons.
[*][b]True[/b] or [b]Auto[/b] - selects the most appropriate option automatically. Recommend putting CTI.Mut last in the mutator load queue if you use this.
[/list]

[*]Use [b][CTI.RemoveItems][/b] to remove items from the trader inventory.
example: [b]Item=KFGame.KFWeapDef_Mac10[/b] will remove MAC10 from sale.

[*]Set [b]bALL=True[/b] if you want to remove all items (can be useful if you want to set the entire sale list in the [b][CTI.AddItems][/b] section yourself).
[*]Set [b]bHRG=True[/b] to remove HRG items.
[*]Set [b]bDLC=True[/b] to remove DLC items.

[*]Use [b][CTI.AddItems][/b] to add items to the trader inventory.
example: [b]Item=WeaponPackExt.KFWeapDef_XM25[/b] will add XM25 to sale.
[/list]

[h1]üìå Notes[/h1]
[list]
[*]If you need an empty list anywhere (for example, you don't want to delete trader weapons), leave at least one line there:
[b]Item=[/b]
This is necessary to explicitly initialize the list (because of the bug mentioned above) to avoid initialization with incorrect values.
[*]This mutator does not include custom weapons. You must have the required weapon packs in your subscriptions to be able to add them to the trader.
[*]If you use this mutator to add weapons, avoid enabling mutators from weapon packs (having them in subscriptions is enough).

[h1]‚òëÔ∏è Status: Completed[/h1]
‚úîÔ∏è The mutator works with the current version of the game (v1150) and I have implemented everything I planned.
‚õîÔ∏è Development has stopped: I no longer have the time or motivation to maintain this mod. No further updates or bug fixes are planned.
